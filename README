= randomext
The library extends class Random in the Ruby standard library.

== Overview
The Random class in the Ruby standard library supports only 
random sampling from discrete/continuous uniform distribution.

This library provides random sampling methods from 
many kinds of probability distributions such as:
* normal (Gaussian)
* lognormal
* Cauthy
* levy
* exponential
* Laplace
* Rayleigh
* Weibull
* Gumbel
* gamma
* beta
* power
* chi_square
* F
* t
* Wald (inverse Gaussian)
* Pareto
* logistic
* von Mises
* Bernoulli
* binomial
* Poisson
* geometric
* negative binomial
* log series
* Zipf-Mandelbrot
* zeta

== Usage
To use this library, you need to install randomext gem:
  gem install randomext
And write 
  require 'randomext'
in your ruby script, then you can use some additional methods in Random class.

== References
Almost all algorithms are based on:

I examine numpy to select nice distributions.
