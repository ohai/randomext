randomext

= Overview
This library extends class Random in the Ruby standard library.
The Random class in the Ruby standard library supports only 
random sampling from discrete/continuous uniform distribution.

This library provides random sampling methods from 
many kinds of probability distributions such as:
  * normal (Gaussian)
  * lognormal
  * Cauthy
  * levy
  * exponential
  * gamma
  * beta
  * chi_square
  * F
  * Bernoulli
  * binomial
  * Poisson

= Usage
require 'randomext' and some methods and classes are added to class Random.
